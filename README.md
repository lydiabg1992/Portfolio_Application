iMTV: Your life as a Music Video**

This application is an interactive and fun program that creates a playlist of music based on a handful of user input relating to mood, speed, type of activity, and overall goal.

Once a user selects their activity (running, hiking, biking, etc), their desired vibe (upbeat, melancholy, slow, flowy), and their intended goal (get faster, get slower or stay the same), the program produces a playlist of music based on the Spotify API's audio track features. Each activity is analyzed by step count and beats per minute, pairing with a playlist of songs that match the vibe of the activity.
